# Dashboard UI

This app lets users interact with their accounts and make/update orders and their info.

## How to run locally

You can start the app locally with the following commands:

- `npm i`
- `npm start`

It should run on `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Project structure

The `elements` folder will have the smaller, reusable functionality, like search bars and styled containers.

The `components` folder will have the compound functionality, like the navbar and header.

The `screens` folder will have the larger functionality that makes up a whole page, like the user info and user actions pages.
